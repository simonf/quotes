The one emphasizes algebraic structure while the other emphasizes geometric interpretation.  Klein's analysis shows one process alternately dominating the other in the historical development of mathematics.  But there is no necessary reason that the two processes should operate in mutual exclusion.  Indeed, each process is undoubtedly grounded in one of the two great capacities of the human mind:  the capacity for language and the capacity for spatial perception.

When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations.

But they out-smarted us, and figured out ways to get a good score that had nothing to do with whether the beam balanced or not.... Betty figured out that the way to get a good score is to put the weights in what you know is a wrong place, and then have everyone on your team say it is wrong.  Thus, they will each get a point for predicting correctly....  A couple years later, when I put a balance beam and some weights on a table at the back of my class, and just left it there without saying anything about it or trying to \"teach\" it, most of the children in the class, including some very poor students, figured out just by messing around with it how it worked.", "title": "How Children Fail", "author": "John Holt"},

It was just an accident. Advertisers had little choice other than to have their money used that way, since they didn't really have any other vehicle for display ads.The old difficulties and costs of printing forced everyone doing it into a similar set of organizational models; it was this similarity that made us regard Daily Racing Form and L'Osservatore Romano as being in the same business. That the relationship between advertisers, publishers, and journalists has been ratified by a century of cultural practice doesn't make it any less accidental.The competition-deflecting effects of printing cost got destroyed by the internet, where everyone pays for the infrastructure, and then everyone gets to use it.

{"quote": "All of the elements eventually used in the Smalltalk user interface were already to be found in the sixties, as different ways to access and invoke the functionality provided by an interactive system. The two major centers of ideas were Lincoln Labs and RAND corp, both ARPA funded. The big shift that consolidated these ideas into a powerful theory and long-lived examples came because the LRG [Learning Research Group] focus was on children. Hence, we were thinking about learning as being one of the main effects we wanted to have happen. Early on, this led to a 90 degree rotation of the purposed of the user interface from \"access to functionality\" to \"environment in which users learn by doing.\" This new stance could now respond to the echos of Montessori and Dewey, particularly the former, and got me, on rereading Jerome Bruner, to think beyond the children's curriculum to a \"curriculum of the user interface.\"The particular aim of LRG was to find the equivalent of writing -- that is, learning and thinking by doing in a medium -- our new \"pocket universe.\" For various reasons I had settled on \"iconic programming\" as the way to achieve this, drawing on the iconic representations used by many ARPA projects in the sixties. My friend Nicholas Negroponte, an architect, was extremely interested in how environments affected peoples' work and creativity. He was interested in embedding the new computer magic in familiar surroundings. I had quite a bit of theatrical experience in a past life, and remembered Coleridge's adage that \"people attend 'bad theatre' hoping to forget, people attend 'good theatre' aching to remember.\" In other words, it is the ability to evoke the audience's own intelligence and experiences that makes theatre work.Putting all this together, we want an apparently free environment in which exploration causes desired sequences to happen (Montessori); one that allows kinesthetic, iconic, and symbolic learning -- \"doing with images makes symbols\" (Piaget & Bruner); the user is never trapped in a mode (GRAIL); the magic is embedded in the familiar (Negroponte); and which acts as a magnifying mirror for the user's own intelligence (Coleridge). It would be a great finish to ths story to say that having articulated this, we were able to move straightforwardly to the design as we know it today. In fact, the UI design work happened in fits and starts in between feeding Smalltalk itself, designing children's experiments, trying to understand iconic construction, and just playing around.

{"quote": "Now imagine an early man surveying his surroundings at the end of a happy day's tool making.... Man the maker looks at his world and says 'So who made this then?' Who made this? ... Early man thinks, 'Well, because there's only one sort of being I know about who makes things, whoever made all this must therefore be a much bigger, much more powerful and necessarily invisible, one of me and because I tend to be the strong one who does all the stuff, he's probably male'. And so we have the idea of a god. Then, because when we make things we do it with the intention of doing something with them, early man asks himself, 'If he made it, what did he make it for?' Now the real trap springs, because early man is thinking, 'This world fits me very well. Here are all these things that support me and feed me and look after me; yes, this world fits me nicely' and he reaches the inescapable conclusion that whoever made it, made it for him.This is rather as if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in - an interesting hole I find myself in - fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.", "title": "Speech at Digital Biota 2", "author": "Douglas Adams"},

But if you sift through the original reviews of the Mac and the Lisa... you can't help but be struck by how hard a time the critics had wrapping their minds around the new paradigm.Some of the reviews of the graphic interface struck the ridiculous real-men-don't-do-windows chord... as in this wag from Creative Computing magazine:Icons and a mouse will not make a non-literate person literate.

Sooner or later you must stop pointing and selecting, and begin to think and type.The opposition now seems completely out of place to use, accustomed as we are to the way spatial metaphors can augment thought -- but to those first critics, the visual language seemed like child's play, or a cartoon.  Other reviews missed the point altogether, dismissing the Mac as a tool that only artists and designers would have use for, as though the machine's major innovation was MacPaint's spray can and not the interface itself.  Consider the editorial from Forbes, dated February 13, 1984:[The Macintosh's] best features are for computer novices: MacPaint, a program that creates graphic designs of stunning complexity, and MacWrite, a word-processing program that goes to ingenious lengths to set up the screen to look like a typewriter. Both are controlled by the machine's \"mouse,\" which moves the cursor without the user's touching the keyboard.  Such simplicity is not aimed at big corporations.  The average middle manager has litte need for the graphics capability of MacPaint.  Most managers have a hard enough time writing reports, without having to worry about designing them as well.The ease with which the author dismisses the brilliance of those original programs (\"such simplicity\") is breathtaking, of course, but even more arresting is how the graphic interface itself flies completely below his radar.  There's not even a passing reference to the potential virtues of organizing information visually...

It's enormous! There are billions of people contributing to the past. And every time we think the present is real, we cannot see the rest of the past.  So we have to destroy the present.Once you get rid of it, it's a scary situation, because you said, \"I'm not going to have anything based on the past.\"  Of course that's not possible; you're just trying.  But sometimes you get a little feeling.  And this not an idea; it's just a feeling.  It's like an odor of perfume. But the fun thing is that little feeling can actually lead you to look in the past in different places than you normally do, and you can bring those up to that feeling. And once you do that, that feeling starts expanding into a vision, and the vision expands into an actual idea...Some of the most creative people I know actually operate this way. This is where those ideas come from that are not just incremental to the present. They come out of vague, even muscular sensations, that you have to go chasing to find out what they are.

{"quote": "In 1823, [Sadi Carnot] was ready to publish what he had discovered.  Before putting pen to paper, he had adopted two guidelines, each admirable in its own right, but fatal in combination: By neatly canceling each other out, they condemned his book to almost total oblivion.  First, he decided to address himself to the general public rather than an audience of scientist and engineers.  This decision establishes the book, which much later assumed its rightful place among the classics of science, as the last member of a noble tradition.  Galileo himself had started the trend by writing in popular Italian instead of Latin, by keeping mathematical details to a minimum, and by perfecting a lively literary style.  Galileo's writings were enormously influential, but after the time of Newton another genre, densely mathematical in content and highly professional in tone, had become predominant, particularly in physics.Carnot's second guideline, and the essence of his greatness, was to embrace generality. Inspired by his father, who had written a successful book on the analysis of simple mechanical machines, Carnot undertook to develop a general theory of steam engines that would rise above the practical questions of design and materials that were of immediate interest to engineers.A popular explanation of the advantages of the the steam engine, or a general treatise of the theory of extracting work from heat, might have made its mark.  But the public was too unsophisticated to understand a general theory, and the technical people too contemptuous to bother with what seemed to be a popularization of a complex subject.  By trying to address two audiences at once, Carnot excluded both.  His Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire received only one, albeit enthusiastic, review, and a decade later, three years after its author's death at thirty-six, one single citation in a science text alone bore the burden of keeping his memory alive.", "title": "Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat, p38", "author": "Hans Christian Von Baeyer"},

{"quote": "Gordon Moore asked me whether tunneling would be a major limitation on how small we could make transistors in an integrated circuit.  That question took me on a detour that was to last nearly 30 years....  I decided to make the question the subject of a talk.  As I prepared for this event, I began to have serious doubts about my sanity.  My calculations were telling me that, contrary to all the current lore in the field, we could scale down the technology such that everything got better.  The circuits got more complex, they ran faster, and the took less power -- WOW!  The more I looked at the problem, the more I was convinced that the result was correct, so I went ahead and gave the talk.  That talk provoked considerable debate, and at the time most people didn't believe the result.  But by the time the next workshop rolled around, a number of other groups had worked through the problem for themselves, and we were pretty much all in agreement.Back in 1959, Feynman had given a lecture entitled \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\".  That talk had made a big impression me... I became completely absorbed with how the exponential increase in complexity of integrated circuits would change the way that we think about computing.  The viewpoint of the computer industry at the time was an outgrowth of the industial revolution; it was based on what was then called \"the economy of scale.\"  A 1000-horsepower engine cost only four times as much as a 100-horsepower engine.  Therefore, the cost per horsepower became less as the engine was made larger.  It was more cost effective to make a few large power plants than to make many small ones.  Efficiency considerations favored the concentration of technology in a few large installations.  The same was evidently true of computing.  IBM was particularly successful following this strategy.But as I looked at the physics of the emerging technology, it didn't work that way at all. The time required to move data was set by the velocity of light and related electromagnetic considerations, so it was far more effective to put whatever computing was required where the data were located.

It's as if he were saying that a self can be thought of in an abstract way, the way a government is thought of, with a legislative branch, a judicial, an executive, and he was making guesses at what the architecture of a human self is.

It is the difference between knowing the names of all the streets in a city and being able to get from any place, by any desired route, to any other place.Why do we talk and write about the world and our knowledge of it as if they were linear?  Because that is the nature of talk.  Words come out in single file, one at a time; there's no other way to talk or write.  So in order to talk about it, we cut the real undivided world into little pieces, and make these into strings of talk, like beads on a necklace.  But we must not be fooled; these strings of talk are not what the world is like. Our learning is not real, not complete, not accurate, above all not useful, unless we take these word strings and somehow convert them in our minds into a likeness of the world, a working mental model of the universe as we know it.

An example comes to mind that was repeated many times.  When the children had 12 rods, they made a 6 x 2 rectangle.

The broker, in turn, would compile dozens of individual designs and then arrange with a chip manufacturer to have them all etched onto a single silicon wafer, so that the cost could be shared. Finally, the chips would be cut apart, packaged individually, and sent back to the students for testing and experimentation...MOSIS would flourish into the 1990s.

It is precisely because of the enormous success of the QM mathematical formalism that it becomes crucially important to learn what that mathematics means. To find a rational physical interpretation of the QM formalism ought to be considered the top priority research problem of theoretical physics; until this is accomplished, all other theoretical results can only be provisional and temporary.This conviction has affected the whole course of my career. I had intended originally to specialize in Quantum Electrodynamics working with J. R. Oppenheimer; but this proved to be impossible. Whenever I look at any quantum-mechanical calculation, the basic craziness of what we are doing rises in my gorge and I have to stop and try to find some different way of looking at the problem, that makes physical sense.

And the weight of the billions of dollars behind these efforts is likely to be overwhelming. It is sobering to realize that in 1600, 150 years after the invention of the printing press, the top two bestsellers in the British Isles were the Bible and astrology books! Scientific and political ways of thinking were just starting to be invented. The real revolutions take a very long time to appear, because as McLuhan noted, the intial content and values in a new medium is always taken from old media.Now one thing that is possible with computers and networks, that could get around some of the onslaught of \"infobabble,\" is the possibility of making media on the Internet that is \"self teaching.\" Imagine a child or adult just poking around the Internet for fun and finding something--perhaps about rockets or gene splicing--that looks intriguing. If it were like an article in an encyclopedia, it would have to rely on expository writing (at a level chosen when the author wrote it) to convey the ideas. This will wind up being a miss for most netsurfers, especially given the general low level of reading fluency today. The computer version of this will be able to find out how old and how sophisticated is the surfer and instantly tailor a progression of learning experiences that will have a much higher chance of introducing each user to the \"good stuff\" that underlies most human knowledge. A very young child would be given different experiences than older ones--and some of the experiences would try to teach the child to read and reason better as a byproduct of their interest. This is a \"Montesorri\" approach to how some media might be organized on the Internet: one's own interests provide the motivation to journey through an environment that is full of learning opportunities disguised as toys.This new kind of \"dynamic media\" is possible to make today, but very hard and expensive. Yet it is the kind of investment that a whole country should be able to understand and make. I still don't think it is a real substitute for growing up in a culture that loves learning and thinking. But in such a culture, such new media would allow everyone to go much deeper, in more directions, and experience more ways to think about the world than is possible with the best books today.

{"quote": "The Greek alphabet, from which all alphabetic systems are derived, has particular characteristics for making us conscious of our language, or, rather, for determining the kind of consciousness of language that we develop...Eric Havelock writes about \"the superior technology of the Greek alphabet,\" which remains the \"sole instrument of full literacy to the present day\".  That technology was superior to other scripts and to oral modes of communication, in Havelock's account, because it led to a conceptual revolution in ancient Greece in which \"a reflexive syntax of definition, description, and analysis\" was exploited by Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greeks and all their alphabetic successors.  They generated the philosophic, scientific, historical, descriptive, legal, and moral forms of discourse that make up what we call the modern mind...While many of their neighbors were using writing systems to mark pots of grain, wine, and olives, list kings and priests, and celebrate in stylized form victories over traditional enemies, the Greeks began to exploit their writing system in ways none of its inventors could have imagined...  Among much else, it opened up what we call the historical period. Fluent literacy is not simply a matter of thinking and then writing the product of one's thoughts; the writing, rather, becomes a part of the process of thinking.  Extended discursive writing is not an external copy of a kind of thinking that goes on in the head; it represents a distinctive kind of literate thinking.Over the past thirty years, a number of scholars have argued with significant success that the fifth-century developments that had in the earlier part of this century been romantically referred to as the \"Greek miracle\" -- giving birth to democracy, logic, philsophy, history, drama, reflective introspection, and so on so suddenly -- were explainable in large part as an implication of the development and spread of alphabetic literacy...

This has the great advantage of making equality be just identity rather than an inductively defined relation, and also of giving a clear mental picture from the start.  However, I think it has probably also impeded further progress.  Let me explain why.The greatest delight, and at the same time, the greatest mystery, of the Surreal numbers is the amazing way that a few simple \"genetic\" definitions magically create a richly structured Universe out of nothing.  Technically, this involves in particular the facts that each surreal number is repeatedly redefined, and that the functions the definitions produce are independent of form. Surely real progress will only come when we understand the deep reasons why these particular definitions have this property? It can hardly be expected to come from an approach in which this problem is avoided from the start? ...I believe the real way to make \"surreal progress\" is to search for more of these \"genetic\" definitions and seek to understand their properties.", "title": "On Numbers and Games, epilogue", "author": "John Conway"},

{"quote": "The people working on the Semantic Web greatly overestimate the value of deductive reasoning (a persistent theme in Artificial Intelligence projects generally.) The great popularizer of this error was Arthur Conan Doyle, whose Sherlock Holmes stories have done more damage to people's understanding of human intelligence than anyone other than Rene Descartes. Doyle has convinced generations of readers that what seriously smart people do when they think is to arrive at inevitable conclusions by linking antecedent facts.This sentiment is attractive precisely because it describes a world simpler than our own. In the real world, we are usually operating with partial, inconclusive or context-sensitive information. When we have to make a decision based on this information, we guess, extrapolate, intuit, we do what we did last time, we do what we think our friends would do or what Jesus or Joan Jett would have done, we do all of those things and more, but we almost never use actual deductive logic.As a consequence, almost none of the statements we make, even seemingly obvious ones, are true in the way the Semantic Web needs them to be true. Drew McDermott [noted] \"It must be the case that a significant portion of the inferences we want [to make] are deductions, or it will simply be irrelevant how many theorems follow deductively from a given axiom set.\" ...This [absurd syllogism from Dodgson] is the best critique of the Semantic Web ever published, as it illustrates the kind of world we would have to live in for this form of reasoning to work, a world where language is merely math done with words.  ...Statements in the Semantic Web work as inputs to syllogistic logic not because syllogisms are a good way to deal with slippery, partial, or context-dependent statements -- they are not, for the reasons discussed above -- but rather because syllogisms are things computers do well. If the world can't be reduced to unambiguous statements that can be effortlessly recombined, then it will be hard to rescue the Artificial Intelligence project. And that, of course, would be unthinkable.", "title": "The Semantic Web, Syllogism, and Worldview (2003)", "author": "Clay Shirky"},

Schizophrenia is clinical, and humor isn't even psychology, you know. The two of them are closely related, and closely related, both of them, to arts and poetry and religion. So you've got a whole spectrum of phenomena the investigation of any of which throws light on any other. The investigation of none of which is very susceptible to the experimental method.\"\"Because of non-isolatability?\" I [Stewart Brand] think I'm ahead of him this time.\"Because the experiment always puts a label on the context in which you are.  You can't really experiment with people, not in the lab you can't. It's doubtful you can do it with dogs. You cannot induce a Pavlovian nervous breakdown -- what do they call it, 'experimental neurosis' -- in an animal out in the field.\"\"I didn't know that!\" I'm gleeful.More of the Bateson chortle. \"You've got to have a lab.\"\"Why?\"\"Because the smell of the lab, the feel of the harness in which the animal stands, and all that, are context markers which say what sort of thing is going on in this situation; that you're supposed to be right or wrong, for example.\"What you do to induce these neuroses is, you train the animal to believe that the smell of the lab and similar things is a message which tells him he's got to discrimiate between an ellipse and a circle, say.  Right. He learns to discriminate. Then you make the discrimination a little more difficult, and he learns again, and you have underlined the message.  Then you make the discrimination impossible.\"At this point discrimination is not the appropriate form of behavior.  Guesswork is.  But the animal cannot stop feeling that he ought to discriminate, and then you get the symptomalogy coming on.  The one whose discrimination broke down was the experimenter, who failed to discriminate between a context for discrimination and a context for gambling.\"\"So,\" says I, \"it's the experimenter's neurosis that --\"\"-- Has now become the experimental neurosis of the animal. This whole context business has a Heisenberg hook in it much worse than the atoms ever thought of.\" ...\"In the field what happens?\"\"None of this happens. For one thing, the stimuli don't count.

Thinking of the heart as a pump enabled us to understand its function.But we have no similarly useful metaphor to help us understand intellectual or cultural or educational development.

Piaget's is perhaps the best known elaboration of a biology-based metaphor of development, and John Dewey elaborated a conception of education drawing on \"growth\".I have tried to adhere to a nonbiological and rather vague use of \"development\".

{"quote": "The definition of cognition has been unhooked from interaction with the world.  Research on games and puzzles has produced some interesting insights, but the results may be of limited generality.  The tasks typically chosen for laboratory studies are novel ones that are regarded by subjects as challenging or difficult.  D'Andrade has likened the typical laboratory cognitive tasks to feats of athletic prowess.  If we want to know about walking, studying people jumping as high as they can may not be the best approach.Such tasks are unrepresentative in another sense as well.  The evolution of the material means of thought is an important component of culturally elaborated tasks.  It permits a task that would otherwise be difficult to be re-coded and re-represented in a form in which it is easy to see the answer.  This sort of development of material means is intentionally prohibited in puzzle tasks because to allow this sort of evolution would destroy the puzzling aspects of the puzzle.  Puzzles are tasks that are preserved in the culture because they are challenging. If the performance mattered, we would learn to re-represent them in a way that removed the challenge.  That would also remove their value as puzzles, of course.The point is that the tasks that are \"typical\" in laboratory studies of thought are drawn from a special category of cultural materials that have been isolated from the cognitive processes of the larger cultural system.

It is a highly planned and co-operative form of theft. And that form of theft began ten thousand years ago when the harvesters of wheat accumulated a surplus, and the nomads rose out of the desert to rob them of what they themselves could not provide.

{"quote": "Emergency conditions are, almost by definition, rare in the normally functioning peaceful society. That this truism can be forgotten is due mainly to two reasons. First, rats have few motivations other than physiological ones, and since so much of the research upon motivation has been made with these animals, it is easy to carry the rat-picture over to the human being. Secondly, it is too often not realized that culture itself is an adaptive tool, one of whose main functions is to make the physiological emergencies come less and less often. In most of the known societies, chronic extreme hunger of the emergency type is rare, rather than common. In any case, this is still true in the United States. The average American citizen is experiencing appetite rather than hunger when he says \"I am hungry.\" He is apt to experience sheer life-and-death hunger only by accident and then only a few times through his entire life.Obviously a good way to obscure the 'higher' motivations, and to get a lopsided view of human capacities and human nature, is to make the organism extremely and chronically hungry or thirsty. Anyone who attempts to make an emergency picture into a typical one, and who will measure all of man's goals and desires by his behavior during extreme physiological deprivation is certainly being blind to many things. It is quite true that man lives by bread alone -- when there is no bread. But what happens to man's desires when there is plenty of bread and when his belly is chronically filled?At once other (and 'higher') needs emerge and these, rather than physiological hungers, dominate the organism. And when these in turn are satisfied, again new (and still 'higher') needs emerge and so on.

Instead it is a symbolic world: the world of logarithmic representations of numbers.

{"quote": "Of all the many possible ways of representing position and implementing navigation computations in the Western tradition, the chart is the one in which the meaning of the expression of position and the meaning of the operations that produce that expression are most easily understood.  As was noted above, lines of position could be represented as linear equations, and the algorithm applied to find their intersection could be that of simultaneous linear equations. As a physical analog of space, the chart provides an interface to a computational system in which the user's understanding of the form of the symbolic expressions (lines of position) is structurally similar to the user's understanding of the meanings of the expressions (relations among locations in the world).In fact, the similarity is so close that many users find the form and the meaning indistinguishable.  Navigators not only think they are doing the computations, they also invest the interpretations of events in the domain of the representations with a reality that sometimes seems to eclipse the reality outside the skin of the ship.  One navigator jokingly desribed his faith in the charted position by creating the following mock conversation over the chart: \"This little dot right here where these lines cross is where we are! I don't care if the bosun says we just went aground, we are here and there is plenty of water under the ship here.\" For the navigator, the ship is where the lines of position intersect.", "title": "Cognition in the Wild, p 115", "author": "Edwin Hutchins"},
{"quote": "Simply being in the presence of others who are working does not always provide a context for learning from their actions. In the example above, the fact that the work was done in [a conversation] between the plotter and the bearing recorder opened it to other members of the team. In a similar way, the design of tools can affect their suitability for joint use or for demonstration and may thereby constrain the possibilities for knowledge acquisition. The interaction of a task performer with a tool may or may not be open to others, depending upon the nature of the tool itself.  The design of a tool may change the horizon of observation of those in the vicinity of the tool.For example, because the navigation chart is an explicit graphical depiction of position and motion, it is easy to \"see\" certain aspects of solutions.  The chart representation presents the relevant information in a form such that much of the work can be done on the basis of perceptual inferences. Because the work done with a chart is performed on its surface -- all of the work is at the device's interface, as it were -- watching someone work with a chart is much more revealing of what is done to perform the task than watching someone work with a calculator or a computer.The openness of a tool can also affect its use as an instrument of instruction. When the bearing recorder chooses a set of landmarks that result in lines of position with shallow intersections, it is easy to show him, on the chart, the consequences of his actions and the nature of the rememdy required...  Imagine how much more difficult it would be to explain the inadequacy of the landmark assignment if the lines of position were represented as equations to be punched into a calculator rather than as lines drawn on the chart.", "title": "Cognition in the Wild, p 270", "author": "Edwin Hutchins"},

I say this not so much because of the controversial empirics-cum-mathematics of the climate-forecasting models as because of a basic insight of modernity that goes back to Rousseau: humanity is the adaptable species. What would have been unimaginable or seemed all but unintelligible 100 years ago, let alone 500 (a sliver of time in the evolutionary life of a species), can become ordinary in a generation. That is how long it took to produce \u2018digital natives\u2019, to accustom people to electricity and television, and so on for each revolution in our material and technological world. It takes a great deal of change to break through this kind of adaptability.This is all the more so because rich-country humanity already lives in a constant technological wrestling match with exogenous shocks, which are going to get more frequent and more intense in the Anthropocene. Large parts of North America regularly experience droughts and heat waves that would devastate a simpler society than today\u2019s US. Because the continent is thoroughly engineered, from the water canals of the West to the irrigation systems of the Great Plains to air conditioning nearly everywhere, these are experienced as inconvenience, as mere \u2018news\u2019. The same events, in poorer places, are catastrophes.", "title": "Anthropocene fever", "author": "Jedediah Purdy"},
{"quote": "Scientists at Cambridge University have recently re-created Joule's experiment, taking exquisite care to assure authenticity in every detail.. The historical detectives made the unexpected and troubling discovery that the minescule heating of the room caused by the physical exertions of the experimenters overwhelmed the expected rise in temperature of the water!  And even after they overcame that difficulty, along with many other equally serious ones, they were not able to duplicate Joule's published results.Blinded by our belief in the superiority of the present over the past, we might conclude that Joule cheated, but then we would miss the point.  On the contrary, we must admit that he probably knew things that we don't know, and that cannot be communicated by technical papers.  He was the Paganini of the thermometer, and capable of making that instrument perform unimaginable feats.Merely reading it was high art:  \"And since constant practice enaabled me to read off with the naked eye 1/20 of a division, it followed that 1/200 of a degree Fahrenheit was an appreciable temperature.\"  Such precision with the naked eye was and is unheard of.  Joule's friend and champion William Thomson called it magical.  Besides his uncanny ability to read scales, Joule must have relied tacitly on a whole repertoire of tricks and habits that made him in his day the undisputed leader in the field of thermometry, and that we may never rediscover because they are no longer useful.", "title": "Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat, p32", "author": "Hans Christian Von Baeyer"},
{"quote": "Papert likes to claim that Logo, because it is transparently interactive at every step, amounts to letting the child program the machine, rather than having the machine program the child...  True, students write the program, but they must do so on the machine's terms.  They must stay within the machine's language and logic...  Students are free to call a square a box, and they can instruct the machine to turn the box so many degrees this way or that.  But they cannot order the computer to put a Hobbit in the box, or to make the box grow wings and fly away to Middle Earth.  Logo grants the children control over an experimental \"microworld\" in which to do their programming; but the microworld is not the full terrain of the human imagination...  It is well suited to geometrical play but not to fantasy that oversteps those narrow boundaries.  As I read Papert's words, I found myself haunted by the image of the prisoner who has been granted complete freedom to roam the \"microworld\" called jail: \"Stay inside the wall, follow the rules, and you can do whatever you want.\" ...Logo does not allow the artistic imagination to romp; the child who would like to draw a horse, or a space monster, or a clown that does not look like a collection of boxes and circles is going to be out of luck.  Nor does Logo allow the hand to use a pencil to sweep and shade and dance across the page.  Art, like everything else Logo teaches, comes down to fingers stroking a keyboard, a mind working out a program.  In a perverse sense, this may be an excellent lesson in computer science, especially in the artificial intelligence research that underlies Logo; the children learn the grand reductive principle:  If the computer cannot rise to the level of the subject, then lower the subject to the level of the computer.  Possibly, in the Information Age, children will find themselves living in a society where that principle has become the rule in all fields touched by the computer.  Logo might then be seen as a useful preparation for \"real life.\"", "title": "The Cult of Information, p 75, 78", "author": "Theodore Roszak"},

An idea takes us into people's minds, ushers us through their experience.  Understanding an idea means understanding the lives of those who created and championed it.  It means knowing their peculiar sources of inspiration, their limits, their vulnerabilities and blind spots.What our schools must offer the young is an education that lets them make that journey through another mind in the light of other ideas, including some that they have fashioned for themselves from their own experience.  The mind that owns few ideas is apt to be crabbed and narrow, ungenerous and defensive in its judgements.  \"Nothing is more dangerous than an idea,\" Emil Chartier once said, \"when it is the only one we have.\"", "title": "The Cult of Information, p 94", "author": "Theodore Roszak"},

{"quote": "Knowing more than your own field is really helpful in [thinking creatively].  I've always thought that one of the reasons the 1960s was so interesting is that nobody was a computer scientist back then.  Everybody who came into it came into it with lots of other knowledge and interests.  Then they tried to figure what computers were, and the only place they could use for analogies were other areas.  So we got some extremely interesting ideas from that.And of course, the reason being educated is important is simply because you don't have any blue [orthogonal] contexts if you don't have any other kinds of knowledge to think with.  Engineering is one of the hardest fields to be creative in, just because it's all about optimizing, and you don't optimize without being very firmly anchored to the context you're in.

So in fact the thing is not interactive.  I don't know if I can think of any hypertext experiments in research where you haven't been able to make links just as easily as following them.
